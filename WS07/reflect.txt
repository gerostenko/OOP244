1. Why did we choose m_health to be a signed integer? (Hint: what happens if the Hero has a health of 1, and someone does 2 points of damage to them.)
Because m_health should not be negative. 0 is dead, it's impossible to be even more dead than that.

2. Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the class SuperHero? (Hint: do a search in Hero.cpp, does the word “SuperHero” appear anywhere in it?) 
How about the reverse, does SuperHero know about the Hero class?
Hero doesn't need to know about SuperHero, but SuperHero must know about Hero, because this class uses the getters and setters of the base class (Hero).

3. The program prints out “AncientBattle!” when 2 Heros fight. It prints out “SuperFight!” when 2 SuperHeros fight. When you tried to make a Hero fight a SuperHero, 
what did it print out?
"Best Greeks Hero vs Best Comic Book SuperHero", I guess.

4. True or False: are the following a valid program definition for main? 
First one is true, second one is false.

int main()
{
  Hero ("Achilles",  20, 6) * Hero  ("Hector",    30, 5);
}

how about this?

int main()
{
  ( Hero ("Achilles",  20, 6) * Hero ("Hector",    30, 5) ) 
                              *
  ( Hero ("Atalanta",  10, 3) * Hero ("Hippolyta", 10, 2) );
}
