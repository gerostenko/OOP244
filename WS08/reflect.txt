1.What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?
Abstract class is like a wrap for the derivd classes, it containts only pure virtual functions, which
set mandatory functions definitions for the derived classes. The concrete class is a functioning class,
which has its member variables and defined member functions.

2.Why do we need to have a pure virtual function in a base class?
Pure virtual function in a base class make sure that all the derived classes will have their own definition
of the function.

3.Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
I've learnt how to use the virtual and pure virtual functions.
