1). Explain why the copy assignment operator checks for self-assignment before doing anything else.
Because the copy assignment operator deletes the data from the current object, which, if object A = A, will delete the data from the object we copying from.

2). Explain why a class that uses dynamic memory to hold its resources needs custom definitions of its copy constructor and its copy assignment operator.
If we do not declare a copy constructor, the compiler inserts code that implements a shallow copy.  If we do not declare a copy assignment operator, the compiler 
inserts code that implements a shallow assignment. 

3). How did you avoid duplication of code?
Creating new functions, which perform one particular task.

4). List what you have learned in completing this workshop
To create a class that uses dynamic memory, to define a copy contructor which makes a deep copy of an object, to overload operators.
