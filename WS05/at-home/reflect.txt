1.Discuss why the operator+= should return a reference to Fraction.
It should return the reference, because in case of += operator we assign the new value to the current (already created)
object, therefore we need to create an alias to the object. This is why reference is used here. 

2.List your uses of the pointer to the current object to simplify your code.
I used pointer to the current object when overload operator!= and operator+=. 

3.Identify the temporary objects in the tester module.
Line 53, 57, 61 of w5_at_home.cpp

4.Identify simplifications that you could make to your class without affecting the interface to the client code.
This I don't know. 

5.Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
I have learnt how to overload operators; in which cases I need to return by reference/by value; how to overload 
constructors;
